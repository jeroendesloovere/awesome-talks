# Contributing to awsome-talks

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## How to contribute

Create a PR and follow the same markdown format as used in the list. If the talk is deemed interesting enough we will add them to the list.

## What is the criteria for a talk to be added

There are no true guidelines. The talk mostly has to impress me on some level and is preferably about technology I find interesting. 

## What is the goal of this list

This is just an easy reference list for me to link to people I meet who are interested in a certain (tech) topic.

## Why did you start the list

When visiting several conferences and meetups, I kept referring people to video's I've seen about certain topics. As it became quite tedious to keep a log of them all, I just started a list.
